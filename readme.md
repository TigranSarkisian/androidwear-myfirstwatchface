This repository contains the source code for the *My First Watch Face Tutorial* located on [binpress.com][1]. This covers creating a simple watch face that displays the current hour and minute and wearable battery percentage, as well as handling the dimmed state, using the current unofficial API available.

The final result looks like this:

![final][2]

and the simple dimmed state:

![dimmed][3]

The repository also contains the signed APKs (mobile and wear) for trying on your device, as well as the keystore used to generate them. The key alias is **`Android Wear`** and the passwords are all **`watchface`**
